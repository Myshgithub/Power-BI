Power BI community: the source :) https://community.powerbi.com/

Guy in a Cube: amazing YouTube channel with a ton of tutorials

Finally, aside from these free sources, I do strongly recommend reading The Definitive Guide to DAX by Marco Russo and Alberto Ferrari, which can be considered the bible of the language.

# View ConnectWise Data in Power BI via REST API
This seems an interesting project related to Power BI that I get chance to be familiar with it as Developer Intern, and also go through ConnectWise as Developer too:

https://developer.connectwise.com/Products/Manage/Developer_Guide#HTTP_Methods

You can find about all the Connectwise Manage All Endpoints here: https://developer.connectwise.com/Products/Manage/REST#/
But we used just https://developer.connectwise.com/Products/Manage/REST#/ServiceTicketLinks
And this method for the specific project now: https://developer.connectwise.com/Products/Manage/Developer_Guide#HTTP_Methods

# Code and Samples
Here from the following link you can find more about how to make your own custom connector, which is a simple one and good for starting "Hello World" data source:
See the full sample for more information.

- The TripPin tutorial covers the creation of a new data source extension for Power Query, and is very helpful. This tutorial uses a public OData service (TripPin) as a reference source. Although this lesson requires the use of the M engine's OData functions, subsequent lessons will use "Web.Contents", making it applicable to (most) "REST APIs". I do recommend it.

The tutorial is meant to be done sequentially - each lesson builds on the connector created in previous lessons, incrementally adding new capabilities to your connector.
